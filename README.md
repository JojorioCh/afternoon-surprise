# Pokemon Clone

My attempt at making a small pokemon web clone with Javascript, CSS and HTML.

This was done thanks to a tutorial by [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisCourses) who I found through YouTube. A very talented guy who explains things nicely making it easy to understand the steps.
